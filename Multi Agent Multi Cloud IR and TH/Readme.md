# **Overview**

This project is a collection of **Multi-Cloud Threat Hunting and Incident Response (IR) Agents** designed to operate across **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP**. These agents work collaboratively to perform periodic reconnaissance, identify **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)**, detect suspicious behaviors, and execute automated responses. By leveraging cloud-native APIs and automation, the system ensures proactive security management across multi-cloud environments.

## **Key Features**

### **1. Periodic Reconnaissance**
- Automatically scans for exposed assets, misconfigurations, and security vulnerabilities.
- Maps the attack surface across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.

### **2. IoC Identification**
- Correlates data with threat intelligence feeds to flag malicious IPs, domains, file hashes, and behaviors.
- Detects anomalies like unusual API calls, excessive privilege escalations, or unauthorized data access.

### **3. Behavioral Analysis**
- Monitors patterns for suspicious activities such as lateral movement, privilege abuse, or data exfiltration attempts.

### **4. Automated Response**
- Executes predefined playbooks for containment and mitigation, including resource isolation, access revocation, and alerting.

### **5. Centralized Visibility**
- Provides a unified dashboard to visualize findings, automate actions, and generate compliance-ready reports.

## **Agents in the System**

### **1. Recon Agents**
Perform periodic scans to:
- Identify misconfigured resources (e.g., open S3 buckets, excessive IAM roles).
- Detect unpatched vulnerabilities or unused but accessible cloud resources.
- Generate a **dynamic attack surface map** for each cloud platform.

### **2. Log Collector Agents**
Continuously collect and normalize security-related logs from:
- **AWS**: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, GuardDuty.
- **Azure**: Monitor, Security Center, Activity Logs.
- **GCP**: Cloud Logging, VPC Flow Logs, Security Command Center.

### **3. Threat Correlation Agents**
- Cross-reference findings with global threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, MISP).
- Flag malicious IPs, domains, or unusual API activities based on known IoCs.
- Detect patterns of suspicious behavior (e.g., privilege escalation, lateral movement).

### **4. Playbook Orchestrator Agents**
Automate responses such as:
- Quarantining compromised resources.
- Blocking malicious IPs or disabling misconfigured roles.
- Rotating keys or tokens for affected users.

### **5. Incident Dashboard Agents**
- Visualize periodic recon results, detected IoCs, and suspicious behaviors.
- Display automated responses and allow manual override or intervention.
- Provide insights into the current security posture.

### **6. Compliance Monitoring Agents**
- Map findings and responses to compliance standards (e.g., NIST, GDPR, CIS Benchmarks).
- Generate reports with actionable remediation steps to meet compliance requirements.

## **How It Works**

### **1. Periodic Reconnaissance**
- Recon Agents scan the cloud environments at regular intervals to update the attack surface map and detect misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.

### **2. Log Analysis**
- Log Collector Agents pull security logs and normalize them into a unified format for analysis.

### **3. Threat Detection**
- Threat Correlation Agents identify suspicious activities by comparing logs and recon data with threat intelligence feeds and IoCs.

### **4. Behavioral Monitoring**
Agents analyze patterns for anomalies like:
- Unusual login locations or times.
- API call spikes.
- Unauthorized data access attempts.

### **5. Automated Response**
- Playbook Orchestrator Agents execute predefined incident response actions.

### **6. Visualization & Reporting**
- Incident Dashboard Agents provide real-time updates on detected threats, automated responses, and compliance status.
