# **Multi-Cloud Recon System Design**

## **Objective**  
To design a **Multi-Cloud Reconnaissance System** that can identify misconfigurations, exposed assets, and vulnerabilities across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with the goal of providing a unified view of the attack surface across cloud environments.

---

## **Thought Process**
### **1. Approach Considerations**
- Start with a simple and modular system to establish foundational capabilities.
- Evaluate whether to focus solely on reconnaissance or extend to active attack simulations.
- Balance implementation complexity with actionable insights.

### **2. Options Explored**
- **Option 1**: 
  - 3 cloud-specific recon agents to perform periodic scans for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
  - 1 consolidation agent to aggregate and normalize findings into a unified view.
- **Option 2**:
  - Additional agents to first map infrastructure and then simulate attacks for deeper security insights.
  - Increased system complexity but potentially more comprehensive results.

### **3. Criteria for Decision**
- Simplicity and modularity for faster implementation.
- Foundational focus on reconnaissance, with potential for future extensions.
- Immediate utility in identifying vulnerabilities without introducing risks of active attack simulation.

---

## **Decision**  
The system will start with **Option 1**, comprising:
- **3 Recon Agents**: Focused on AWS, Azure, and GCP for periodic scans of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **1 Consolidation Agent**: Aggregates and normalizes the findings from all recon agents to provide a centralized view of the attack surface.

## **Agent Design**

### **Initial Agents**
1. **AWS - R**: Performs reconnaissance on AWS by identifying misconfigured S3 buckets, over-permissive IAM roles, and other exposed assets.
2. **Azure - R**: Scans Azure environments for misconfigured NSGs, excessive role permissions, and exposed services.
3. **GCP - R**: Identifies open storage buckets, unused but accessible service accounts, and misconfigured firewall rules.
4. **Consolidation Agent**: Aggregates data from AWS - R, Azure - R, and GCP - R into a unified attack surface map.

### **Planned Extensions**
- **AWS - IR, Azure - IR, GCP - IR**: Analyze logs and telemetry to detect suspicious behaviors like privilege escalations, unauthorized data access, and lateral movement.
- **Attack Simulation Agents**: Actively test vulnerabilities by simulating real-world attacks such as privilege abuse or data exfiltration.

## **LLM Recommendations for Agents**

### **AWS - R and AWS - IR**
| **LLM**               | **Strengths**                                                                                     | **Best Fit**               |

## **Privacy Considerations**

We are aware of **privacy and security concerns** when using externally hosted LLMs for sensitive data. As part of **v2 of the product**, we are investigating **privately hosted LLMs** to enhance security and control. Some options include:
- **Hugging Face Falcon**: Ideal for fine-tuned, self-hosted deployments.
- **LLaMA 2**: High-performing open-source LLM that can be tailored for cloud-specific workloads.
- **Open-source GPT Alternatives**: Leveraging community-driven advancements in LLM hosting for secure and private solutions.

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Implement the **AWS - R**, **Azure - R**, **GCP - R**, and **Consolidation Agent**.
- Extend the system to include **Identify Suspicious Behavior (IR)** agents.
- Investigate self-hosted LLMs for privacy-first deployments in v2.
