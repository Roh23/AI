# **Multi-Cloud Recon System Design**

## **Objective**  
To design a **Multi-Cloud Reconnaissance System** that can identify misconfigurations, exposed assets, and vulnerabilities across AWS, Azure, and GCP, with the goal of providing a unified view of the attack surface across cloud environments.

---

## **Thought Process**
### **1. Approach Considerations**
- Start with a simple and modular system to establish foundational capabilities.
- Evaluate whether to focus solely on reconnaissance or extend to active attack simulations.
- Balance implementation complexity with actionable insights.

### **2. Options Explored**
- **Option 1**: 
  - 3 cloud-specific recon agents to perform periodic scans for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
  - 1 consolidation agent to aggregate and normalize findings into a unified view.
- **Option 2**:
  - Additional agents to first map infrastructure and then simulate attacks for deeper security insights.
  - Increased system complexity but potentially more comprehensive results.

### **3. Criteria for Decision**
- Simplicity and modularity for faster implementation.
- Foundational focus on reconnaissance, with potential for future extensions.
- Immediate utility in identifying vulnerabilities without introducing risks of active attack simulation.

## **Decision**  
The system will start with **Option 1**, comprising:
- **3 Recon Agents**: Focused on AWS, Azure, and GCP for periodic scans of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.
- **1 Consolidation Agent**: Aggregates and normalizes the findings from all recon agents to provide a centralized view of the attack surface.

---

## **Next Steps**  
- Implement the recon system.
- Ensure extensibility to later integrate infrastructure mapping and attack simulation agents as required.
